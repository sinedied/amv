1. Rename to EITHER one of these depending of the input name:
- "<serie> - Txx - <title>"
- "<serie> - Txx" (if there's no title)
- "<serie> - Intégrale - Txx" (if "intégrale" is in the name)
If it's an "Hors Série" (HS) or no Txx is provided, use "HS" or "HSxx" instead of "TXX". T00 is valid.

2. Fix the case: <title> is capitalized according to French: only first letter of the title and proper nouns are capitalized, the rest is lowercase.

3. Keep spaces and accents.

Serie is "" as-is, and there are no titles
